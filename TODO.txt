= TO FIX =

- [ ] Crash with ntfs4 autmount volume on startup when mpd is starting seems to be before vpn start, seems to crash when automount unmount the volume
    Testing : 
    - [X] disable totaly kernel module for wifi in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
    - [X] disable mpd
    - [X] disable vpn
    - [ ] find an other kernel module
- [ ] Sound with muliple input source is a mess to control simply with the vol keys in i3
    - [ ] Find a solution to bind all input volume togother
    - [ ] Or a good universal setup to have volume control (pamixer installed and i3 conf modifier to use it : see if it's ok)
