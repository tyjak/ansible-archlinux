- [X] fix wifi when /etc/modprobe.d/local-b43 is uncommented: b43 bcma0:1: Direct firmware load for b43/ucode16_mimo.fw failed with error -2

- [ ] zathura put settings in share/.config folder
- [ ] install french / engish dictionary
- [ ] trackpad
    - [ ] finger gesture
    - [ ] verify trackpad deactivated on tappings keyboard (what is the bin that does this)
- [X] backlight restore not working see note: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/backlight#Save_and_restore_functionality
    - [X] see arch hostvar note
    - [ ] create a share/bin/presuspend and put all the scripts in it that are in /etc/systemd/system/suspend@.service
    - [ ] pb if manually suspend and lid closed -> it resumes (see if trackpad is the culprit)
    - [ ] on suspend deactivate trackpad, reactivate on resume ?
- [ ] add backup process
- [ ] add swap memory management
- [ ] emergency quit on heavy load
- [ ] Enable emergency kill on memory overused
- [ ] ernergy setup (switch off scree, halt when battery empty , test seep mode)
    - [ ] for hibernate (with zram) see https://github.com/Nefelim4ag/systemd-swap/issues/85#issuecomment-536539604
- [X] No ssh access to creamy (missing key ?)
- [ ] Test suspend : seems wakeup put disk in read only mode
- [ ] DNS resolution add in ansible template for /etc/systemd/resolved.conf (add DNS conf) and /etc/systemd/network/20-wireless.network (force DNS conf for wireless ineterface)
- [ ] Check that systemd-networked and systemd-resolved are enabled and started in ansible
- [ ] fix Weather in i3pystatus
- [ ] use keys F3 F4 symbol to display last notification and/or cycle within notificaitons history see shortcuts in confi of dunst
- [ ] in ansible add variable to replace username hard coded
- [ ] use archlinux logo in i3pystatus with module for pacman updates number
- [ ] vagrant test installation
    - [ ] don't create user host, use vagrant (actually host user is deployed and install but i3 is set for vagrant not host user)
    - [ ] fix localisation (keyboard messed up qwerty instead of azerty, same in login manager qwerty)

= TO FIX =

- [ ] Crash with ntfs4 autmount volume on startup when mpd is starting seems to be before vpn start, seems to crash when automount unmount the volume
    Testing :
    - [X] disable totaly kernel module for wifi in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
    - [X] disable mpd
    - [X] disable vpn
    - [ ] find an other kernel module
- [ ] Sound with muliple input source is a mess to control simply with the vol keys in i3
    - [ ] Find a solution to bind all input volume togother
    - [ ] Or a good universal setup to have volume control (pamixer installed and i3 conf modifier to use it : see if it's ok)
